# Introduction

This is the README for the portfolio website hosted at [xphelippe.com](https://xphelippe.com). The site is hosted in the cloud on an AWS EC2 instance along with several other applications. NGINX is used to reroute traffic to the appropriate subdomain.

# Resources I found helpful along the way

### [Footer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WoQm7tR6EA)

A useful youtube video that gave me some ideas for how I wanted to structure my footer

### [Slideshow Tutorial](https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-an-auto-play-slideshow-with-react)

An amazing tutorial on how to make a slideshow that I was able to follow along with very easily. Only changes I made were changing pxl -> rem for responsiveness and replacing the slide div with a custom component.

### [Freecodecamp React Portfolio Site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI)

I love freeCodeCamp and this tutorial was a great inspiration for how to structure my website. I learned how to implement my own icons and how to create a contact form with it.

# Future Features

I like where the site is right now, but I also thought of a few nice-to-haves that would take an extensive amount of time to add to the project. If I revisit the design of the site, I might add these in

-   CMS to be able to add more apps to my Apps page and potentially even make the ability to add pages
-   logon so anyone could manage the new CMS
-   google maps on the footer
-   HW page for hardware projects I may do in the future
-   resources page for coding resources I like
